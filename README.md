# LiDAR Device ðŸ¤–
A datasheet and a set of code dedicated to the development of a LiDAR device used to scan hallways up to 4m wide. This project employs a Texas Instruments MSP432E401Y microcontroller and a ToF sensor. Programming was done in C for backend structuring and Python for data visualization. 

All information, including programming workflows and circuit schematics, is provided in the datasheet.

The image below depicts the circuit employed in the finalized edition of the device. It tactically makes use of a shoebox to steadily hold a ToF sensor mounted on a stepper motor. The code flashed onto the microcontroller instructs the motor to spin in a certain direction while the ToF sensor captures distance measurements at various x-axis intervals. After the completion of an _n_ number of sets, a 3D image is compiled via Open3D through Python.

Below is an example of a hallway scan. It is important to note that specific factors like light bulbs and building structure can cause the receptor of the ToF sensor to produce false measurements, hence explaining a few distortions that are visible.
