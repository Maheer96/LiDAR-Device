# LiDAR Device ðŸ¤–
A datasheet and a set of code dedicated to the development of a LiDAR device used to scan hallways up to 4m wide. This project employs a Texas Instruments MSP432E401Y microcontroller and a ToF sensor. Programming was done in C for backend structuring and Python for data visualization. All information, including programming workflows and circuit schematics, is provided in the datasheet.

Below are a couple of images illustrating both an example of a hallway scan and the physical circuit itself.
